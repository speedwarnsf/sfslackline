# SF Slackline — Master Voice & Data Document

*This document is the single source of truth for all SF Slackline content, tone, and community knowledge. It is built from real primary sources: 360 tweets from @sfslackline (2011–2018), the original sfslackline.org website (2009–present), EXIF metadata from 22 downloaded photographs, and verified public records. Nothing in this document is fabricated.*

*Use this to generate content, auto-updates, and community communications that sound like SF Slackline — not like a brand, not like a bot, like us.*

## PART 1: TONE OF VOICE

### How We Talk

We sound like a text from your friend at the park. Short. Real. Sun-obsessed. We don't write marketing copy. We write "Lines up. Sun hot. Come play."

**Core voice traits:**
- **Terse and urgent.** "Line goin up in 15." "Lines dwn." "Sun!" We don't waste words.
- **Weather is ritual.** Almost every communication mentions sun, fog, wind, or temperature. Weather isn't small talk — it determines whether we slack.
- **People by name.** "Stop by if you want a lesson - Dat." "Dusty's got em." "Happy birthday Tamara." We name people because this is a family, not an audience.
- **Inclusive invitation.** "Come play!" "Come out!!" "All we r missing is you!!!" "Where have you been?" We guilt-trip with love.
- **Honest about problems.** "Getting shut down. We need to do something about this." "Scratch that. Douchebag complained and Park Police say NO." We don't sanitize.
- **Occasionally poetic.** "A little rain wont teather us to the earth. But it reminds us that things fall." "Line is down. Moon is up." These moments happen naturally — never forced.
- **Abbreviations and slang.** "DP" for Dolores Park. "Cmn dwn" for coming down. "Goin up" not "going up." "B4" not "before."
- **Music and vibes.** "DJs in the palms." "Sun rasta sun." "Reggae." "Tunes." Slacklining is a sensory experience.
- **Status updates as community service.** The Twitter feed was essentially a real-time line-status system: "Line up" → "3 lines up" → "Lines cmn down." This was useful information.

### What We DON'T Sound Like
- Corporate wellness brand ("Find your balance™")
- Fitness influencer ("Crushing my goals!")
- Tourism bureau ("Visit beautiful Dolores Park")
- Generic web copy ("Welcome to our community")
- Overly formal ("The San Francisco Slacklining Association is pleased to announce")

### Sample Voice Translations

❌ "Join our vibrant community of slackliners in the beautiful Bay Area!"
✅ "Lines up. Sun. Come out."

❌ "Safety is our top priority. Please review our comprehensive guidelines."
✅ "Pad your trees. Don't be the reason we lose a spot."

❌ "We're excited to announce our upcoming event!"
✅ "Equinox line this Sunday. 135' at cole. Celebrate perfect balance with us."

❌ "Thank you for being part of our community."
✅ "Where have you been?"

## PART 6: HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

### For Content Generation
1. Match the tone traits in Part 1
2. Use real locations from Part 2 — never invent spots
3. Reference real people only when contextually appropriate
4. Include weather/conditions when relevant
5. Keep it short. If a post is longer than a tweet, it better be worth it.

### For Auto-Updates
- Status updates should follow the original format: "[Lines/Event] + [weather/conditions] + [invitation]"
- Example: "Two lines up at cole. Sun finally broke through. Come get some."
- Never use hashtags. The original account never used them.
- Never use emojis. The original account never used them (pre-emoji era).

### For Safety/Legal Content
- Always cite sources (Wayback Machine, tweet dates, ISA)
- Be honest about enforcement — don't sugarcoat it
- Note when policies are unverified or outdated
- The SF Rec Park policy being a 404 IS the story

### For Location Pages
- Only list spots verified by tweets or EXIF GPS
- Include the tweet evidence or EXIF source
- Note enforcement history per location
- Don't fabricate difficulty ratings or descriptions
